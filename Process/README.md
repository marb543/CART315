### Dumb Ways to Fall Level 1 Design :  
 
I began the design of the first level of my small platformer game. I first got familiar with the elements of PocketPlatform which is a tool on itch.io that allows users to quickly design a platformer game with the look and the feel of a Mario game. I first began with exploring how to set the background of the game, and added decorative elements like clouds. I also wanted to interact with dangerous objects of the game like the fire spots so when the player touches them he instantly restarts the level because the character instantly died.

I then continued to design the first level. I got more familiar with other objects of the game such as ice  blocks which are slippery to make it harder for the player to reach the end of the level. I also added an enemy to the beginner to the game as well as an underground passage where the player can collect double 
ability to jump.

As I continued the design of the first level I have encountered issues like trying to make a challenging enough level for the player. I feel like so far the level that I have designed is a bit too easy so I found the portal object in the platform designer and placed it in the secret passage  which would teleport the player to the end of the level. I also added blocks that disappear when they are touched.

For the end of the level I added some difficulty to the game which is to place secret objects on blocks which when touched, instantly kill the player. I also placed a sign which instructs the player to find a secret passage. I also added a second portal to the beginning which is easier to reach if the player falls from the ice blocks.

### Level 2 Design :  
 
For the design of the second level I have begun making it look pretty by adding clouds.

I continued the design of the second level by making it winter themed. I added an underground passage with enemies that the player will have to cross if he wishes to collect coins. In fact, I implemented a coin system for this level . There is also a hole in the blocks so if the player falls through to the right he 
instantly dies.

While continuing to work on the level, I have added a rocket launcher so when the player jumps on blocks to the end of the level, he has to do so quickly enough or he will get eliminated. The player must also jump on the purple blocks quickly enough because the purple blocks disappear when they are touched.

Finally to end the level, I have put fire and spiky blocks so if the player falls he instantly restarts the level. If quick enough, the player can also collect coins . However, this part of the level is a trap because itâ€™s virtually impossible for the player to get to the end of the level.

We tested my game in class, and people loved it. They even tried to speed run the game.
